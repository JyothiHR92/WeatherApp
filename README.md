# Forecast
Forecast Android Application using WeatherStack API. Built using MVVM and Android Architecture Components in Kotlin

Following ResoCoder's Playlist about Apixu Weather Api I've developed the application using current weatherstack.
In this application users can 
  - See the current weather
  - Use device location or type custom location
  - Change between metric or imperial units

Libraries:
  - Navigation
  - ROOM
  - Gson
  - Kotlin Android Coroutines
  - Retrofit
  - lifecycle ViewModel
  - Preference
  - WeatherLocation
  - Material Design
